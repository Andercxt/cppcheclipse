# Introduction #
You can configure the following topics here.
  1. [General](WorkspacePreferences#Settings.md)
  1. [Advanced Settings](#Advanced_Settings.md)
  1. [Build](#Build.md)
  1. [Problems](WorkspacePreferences#Problems.md)
  1. [Suppressions](#Suppressions.md)

Some settings can be taken over from the appropriate [workspace preferences](WorkspacePreferences.md) page. This can be accomplished by selecting the radio button "Use workspace settings". You can even directly jump to the referring workspace preference page by clicking on "Configure Workspace Settings..."

You can enter any additional command line arguments as a string here. Please regard that these command line arguments will be transfered additionally to those, which are set in [General](WorkspacePreferences#Settings.md).
First have a look, if any of the command line arguments you want to use, are available in [General](WorkspacePreferences#Settings.md).
For a description of valid arguments have look at the [cppcheck manual](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/manual.pdf).
