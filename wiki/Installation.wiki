= Introduction =

cppcheclipse is an Eclipse plugin, which can be installed over the update mechanism, provided by Eclipse. The plugin is platform independent but still needs a current cppcheck binary. You can get a binary (for Windows) or the source code for all other platforms at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppcheck/. 

= Requirements =
  * Java 1.5 or newer
  * Eclipse 3.4 or 3.5 with CDT
  * cppcheck (1.40 or newer)

= Installation =

  # Click on Help->Install New Software...
  # Add the new Update Site http://cppcheclipse.googlecode.com/svn/update/
  # From this Update Site you can download and install cppcheclipse
  # Click on Preferences->C/C++->cppcheclipse to setup the path to the cppcheck binary on your computer

= Update =
Cppcheclipse checks automatically for updates of cppcheck. This behaviour can be configured via the Eclipse Preferences->C/C++->cppcheclipse. To update cppcheclipse itself, go to Help->Check for Updates.

= Dropin Installation =
Instead of using the recommended update site installation you can use the provided zip file of the latest cppcheclipse, which is available at Downloads, for using it with the dropins folder of eclipse. The advantage of this way is, that deinstalling this plugin is as easy as removing the zip file from the dropins folder, but there is the disadvantage, that eclipse cannot automatically update those plugins.
